			<h3>For those who feel stuck and discouraged when it comes to communicating in English.</h3>
			
			<p>Call me a mentor, a coach, a personal trainer that specializes in English language acquisition. I work with clients who have studied English in formal settings but lack the skills and confidence to express themselves effectively. I can help you avoid the pitfalls and overcome the hurdles commonly found when learning English. First, we will zero in on the things you struggle with the most. Then, I will show you exactly how to improve and work with you until you do.</p>
			<p>Your particular needs are paramount and will drive the curriculum. Most folks find it helpful to improve their accent. Most want to master the slang and idioms of everyday speech. Others need to become fluent in the jargon associated with a particular field or industry. Finally, everyone benefits by practicing complex scenarios&mdash;persuading others, giving explanations, handling disagreements, and managing conflict. Above all, I strive to build your confidence with every encounter and intervention.</p>
			<p><strong>Tier One</strong> is a premium service for those who are serious about improving their English. I provide one on one attention as often and as rigorous as you require. I accept a limited number of clients to maximize what I can offer each one.</p>
			<p><strong>My Approach.</strong> Immediate feedback with suggestions you can use right away for better results. Real world personal and professional scenarios that fit your lifestyle and career path. Editorial support to improve writing. Emphasis on public speaking and presentation. 24/7/365 access and availability on short notice.</p>
			<p>Problem oriented. Solution focused. One to one. On demand.</p>
			<p><strong>Tier One</strong> makes English work for you.</p>
